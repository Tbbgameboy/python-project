# Expense Tracker

I found out what an expense tracker is and know what it is used for. An expense tracker is a program designed to help users record,categorize and manage their financial expenditures.
I took the tools i am going to use for the project: 
i.    The expense tracker should have (date,amount,category, and note). It should be a class (class Expense:)
ii.   We save expenses to a csv file (I learnt how to do that). comma seperate Value (CSV) files offer simple perisitent structured storage. We can work with csv files using standard python       file methods, but using the python csv library makes it easier to handle data from a csv file.
iii.  Show summary report (total spent, Per category, number of transactions). Like after all amount have been shown in each of the class. There should be a summary report of the total            things spent in each class.
     e.g. date - 30/9/2025
          amount - 3000
          category - rice 
note: this is the list summary of what we did on the 30 september 2025
iv.   I input validation (no negative amount, correct date format). They should be no negative value in the code in the amount . e.g -300 or -10,000 (bad) and they should be a correct date        format like today's date 26|09|2025 and tomorrows date with next week's date or next years date.
v.    We should add and run our instructs in our README.MD files.

I used apps like csv header documentation and prettytable.com.
